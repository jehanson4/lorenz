Lorenz Lab -- Notes for Lab #6 -- Multiple Timeseries

This lab adds support for multiple independent timeseries.

This enables it to show the sensitive dependence on initial conditions
characteristic of the Lorenz system and other chaotic systems. This
version of the LorenzLab app has two independent timeseries from the
same Lorenz system, which differ only by a tiny amount in the
starting point.
