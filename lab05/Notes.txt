Lorenz Lab -- Notes to Lab #5 -- The Lorenz Equations

In this lab we finally get to see the Lorenz system. It is used as the data source
instead of RandomWalker. (RandomWalker is kept around for use in subsequent labs.)
Important new features:

* ODESystem: interface used to represent systems of ordinary differential equations

* LorenzSystem: an ODESystem that embodies the Lorenz equations

* RungeKuttaIntegrator: generates data points by numerically integrating an ODESystem
