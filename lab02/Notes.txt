LorenzLab -- Notes for Lab #2 -- Data Points and Transforms

Building on Lab #1, this defines some of the classes used for representing and
displaying the Lorenz system's behavior. It adds the following main features:

* DataPoint: represents a point in the Lorenz system's phase space

* SimpleDataTransform: converts DataPoints into pixel locations in a very simple
  way. Adjusts itself as necessary in response to changes in the the window size.

* Viewer: a holder for the stuff needed to view the system's evolution.
