Lorenz Lab -- Notes for Lab #3 -- Data Plumbing

This adds basic support for animating the Lorenz system's behavior. It uses an
event-based model in which data points are generated on one execution thread and
delivered as "events" to a "listener", which then makes them available for display
in the GUI.

The important new features are:

* Abstract class DataSource and its helpers DataSourceEvent and DataSourceListener

* RandomWalker: a DataSource implementation that generates data points according
  to a random walk within a 3-d region

* Enhancements to Viewer. It's a DataSourceListener now, and it contains a cache of
  data points to be displayed whenever appropriate.
