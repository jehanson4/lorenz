Lorenz Lab -- Notes for Lab #3 -- Data Plumbing

This adds basic plumbing classes for separating the code that generates data
from the code that displays it. The important new features are:

* Abstract class DataSource and its helpers DataSourceEvent and DataSourceListener

* RandomWalker: a DataSource implementation that generates data points according
  to a random walk within a 3-d region

* Enhancements to Viewer. It's a DataSourceListener now, and it contains a cache of
  data points to be displayed whenever appropriate.
