LorenzLab -- Notes for Lab #4 -- Animation

This lab adds rudimentary animation. Data points are created on a separate
thread. The UI has buttons to start and stop it. New class is:

* Controller: UI widgets, and the logic behind them, to start and stop the
  generation of points; to reset (i.e., discard all points) and to generate
  one point at a time.
